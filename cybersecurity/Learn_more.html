                <p>A cyber attack is an assault launched by cybercriminals using one or more computers against  
                    single or multiple computers or even networks. It can maliciously disable computers, steal data,
                    or use a breached computer as a launch point for other attacks.They are a threat to your
                     sensitive data, as attackers use new methods powered by social engineering and artificial 
                     intelligence (AI) to bypass traditional data security controls.

                <p><b>Cybersecurity</b> is the process of protecting and recovering computer systems,
                   networks, devices, and programs from any type of cyber attack.
                   <h3>Importance of Cybersecurity:</h3>
                   Whether you are an individual, small business, or a large multinational, you rely on
                   computer systems every day. This dependency on computers increases the likelihood of
                   cybercrime happening to you, which means some form of cyber security protection is needed.
                   <ul>
                    <li>Cybercrime is so prevalent that anyone who browses the internet is a potential victim.</li>
                    <li>Data Leaks that could result in identity theft are now publicly posted on social media accounts.</li>
                    <li>Sensitive information like social security numbers, credit card information and bank account details
                        are now stored in cloud storage services like Dropbox or Google Drive.</li>
                    <li>Organizations of all sizes from every industry on earth have been hit by 
                        cyberattacks, be it social media giant Facebook or ride-sharing giant Uber.</li>   
                   </ul>
